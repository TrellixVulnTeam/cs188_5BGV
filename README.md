## Search (proj1)
We implemented DFS, BFS, UCS, and A* searches. We then created state representations for a very simple Pacman game (no ghosts) with differing goals and implemented complete and optimal heuristics that would travel to all corners or eat all the food dots. We also implemented  a suboptimal heuristic to greedily find the closest food dot.
